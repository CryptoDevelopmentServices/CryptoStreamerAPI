# CryptocurrencyCheckout CryptoStreamer API Widget

This Widget is a basic example of how to connect to and use the CryptocurrencyCheckout CryptoStreamer API.
The intended use of this API is to allow Cryptocurrencies to easily and automatically display Twitch.tv Streamers that accept their Coin/Token onto their website.

## What is Twitch.tv and why would my coin want exposure on their platform?

* Twitch.tv is an online streaming site for Gamers, eSports, and Creative Content Creators, it averages an impressive 15 million Daily Active Users.

* By offering to display a Twitch.tv streamers stream on your website/platform, you greatly increase the likelihood of them accepting your cryptocurrency.

* The more streamers that accept your coins for donations, the more exposure that your project will gain through the twitch.tv platform.

* The added entertainment of your community being able to watch and interact with these streamers directly on your website will also increase engagement, and keep your project on their minds.




## How does this widget work?

* This is a very basic example of how you can use the CryptocurrencyCheckout CryptoStreamer API.


* When a user signs up to CryptocurrencyCheckout and integrates our Twitch.tv Donation Integration into their Twitch Stream, they will be asked if they would like to participate in accepting your cryptocurrency as donations in exchange for some exposure.


* If they say yes, our platform will automatically add them and their stream details to our API.


* The code here will then see the new user accepting your coin through the API call, and it will automatically begin displaying that user on your website/platform with little to no effort on your part.
